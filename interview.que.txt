1) Differences between Promise.all() and Promise.allSettled
Promise.all()=> Promise.all() method rejects itself if any Promise will be rejects from an array its executing only resolve promises . 
if any promises will be reject so it will go in atomatic in reject
Promise.allSettled() =>  Promise.allSettled() its heandling all asynchronus opration where is resolve and reject

2) what is Currying function (करी function)
 Currying in JavaScript is a process in which you can transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nesting functions
It returns a new function that expects the next argument inline

3) What is the difference between HAVING and WHERE in SQL?
The WHERE clause in SQL allows you to filter data from specific rows (individual rows) from a table based on certain conditions. In contrast
 the HAVING clause in SQL allows you to filter data from a group of rows in a query based on conditions involving aggregate values

4) What are models in Mongoose?
Data modeling refers to the organization of data within a database and the links between related entities. 
Data in MongoDB has a flexible schema model, which means: Documents within a single collection are
 not required to have the same set of fields. A field's data type can differ between documents within a collection

5) which formate store data in mongodb ?
its store josn-boject data

6) slice()` creates a new array containing selected elements from the original, while 
ex : let cars = ['Benz', 'Innova', 'Breeza', 'Etios', 'Dzire'];
let new_cars = cars.slice(1, 4);
console.log("cars :", cars);
console.log("new_cars :", new_cars);

7) `splice()` modifies the original array by adding, removing, and deleting 
ex: let cars = ['Benz', 'Innova', 'Breeza', 'Etios', 'Dzire'];
cars.splice(2, 0, 'ambassedor', 'BMW', 'Audi');
console.log("cars :", cars);


8) How to compare two objects
// let obj = { name: "manvi" }
// let obj1 = { name: "manvi" }

let obj1 = {
    name: "John",
    age: 23,
    degree: "CS"
};

let obj2 = {
    name: "John",
    age: 23,
    degree: "CS"
};

console.log(areObjectsEquals(obj1, obj2));
// console.log("ppppp=========>>", obj === obj1)






9) What is a prototype in JavaScript?
Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is 
itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's
 called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.


10) What is the difference between Microtask and Macrotask? ( माइक्रोटास्क और मैक्रोटास्क में क्या अंतर है? )


The main difference between microtask and macrotask queue is their priority. The event loop always gives higher priority to the microtask queue, and will process all the callbacks in the microtask queue before moving on to the macrotask queue.

The microtask queue contains the callbacks of operations that are considered more urgent or important, such as promises and mutation observers APIs.

The macrotask queue contains the callbacks of operations that are less urgent such as timers, I/O events, and user interface events.
